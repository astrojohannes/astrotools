# Calculate Total Infrared Surface Density from any combinations of Herschel and Spitzer bands

*The script is based on Table 3 of [Galametz et al. (2013)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/431/2/1956/1469965)

This version of **calc_sigtir** extends the version available through the [CPROPSTOO/physical package](https://github.com/akleroy/cpropstoo/tree/master/physical).
It implements the full table of surface density conversions and optionally includes uncertainty calculations via error propagation.
